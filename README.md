# commacd

A faster way to move around (Bash 3+).

Changed in this fork: an option to use space instead of `/` as directory separator.
Please see [this commit](https://github.com/schoettl/commacd/commit/17176ce48ccdfc255e577a555de0cb7700a85879).

> While going through "Usage" section please keep in mind that `commacd` is NOT an [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump)/[z](https://github.com/rupa/z)/[fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) alternative nor they are mutualy exclusive. It doesn't track history, write any logs, nothing like that. It really is just an improved `cd`.

## Installation

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyiko/commacd/master/commacd.bash -o ~/.commacd.bash && \
  echo "source ~/.commacd.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

> On OS X you'll need to make sure ~/.bashrc is sourced from ~/.bash_profile (http://ss64.com/osx/syntax-bashrc.html). 

## Updating to the latest version

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyiko/commacd/master/commacd.bash -o ~/.commacd.bash
```

## Usage

`commacd` exports three commands: `,` (for jumping forward), `,,` (backward) and `,,,` (backward+forward):

> All three of them try to match by prefix first. Only if no results are found, will they fallback to substring (fuzzy) matching (0.2.0+).

```sh
~$ , des
  => cd Desktop

# move through multiple directories
~$ , /u/l/ce
  => cd /usr/local/Cellar

# allow me to choose directory in case of ambiguous pattern (= multiple choices)
~$ , d
  => 1 Desktop
     2 Downloads
     : <type index of the directory to cd into>

# given two directories jdk7 and jdk8 on the Desktop, cd into jdk8 without hitting 
# interactive mode (the one shown above)
~/github$ , ~/d/j*8
  => cd ~/Desktop/jdk8

# cd into directory having 'esk' somewhere in its name
~/github$ , ~/esk # in pre-0.2.0 that would be `, ~/*esk`
  => cd ~/Desktop

# go all the way up to the project root (in this case, the one that has .git in it)
~/github/lorem/src/public$ ,,
  => cd ~/github/lorem

# cd into to the first (closest) parent directory named g*
~/github/vimium/src/public$ ,, g
  => cd ~/github

# substitute jekyll with ghost
~/github/jekyll/test$ ,, jekyll ghost
  => cd ~/github/ghost/test

# jump to some other project (in this case, located in ~/github)
~/github/rook/src/public$ ,,, binlog # in pre-0.2.0 you would need to use `m*binlog` 
  => cd ~/github/mysql-binlog-connector-java
```

As a bonus, all three aliases support `<Tab>` expansion (try `, /u/lo<Tab>`) and can be combined with other tools (e.g. ``ls `, /u/lo` ``).

## Development

make # lint sources and run tests 
```

## Changelog

- 0.3.1 - Fixed VCS root lookup (`,,`) in case of nested checkouts (`/.../checkout_1/.../checkout_2`).
- 0.3.0 - Improved tab completion. "multiple choices" can now start with 1 (still 0 by default, but can be changed using `export COMMACD_SEQSTART=1`) (thanks to [@skorochkin](https://github.com/skorochkin)).
- 0.2.1 - Ordered prefix/substring matching of `,,`.
- 0.2.0 - Added substring (fuzzy) matching as a fallback to the default prefix lookup (can be turned off with `export COMMACD_NOFUZZYFALLBACK="on"`).
- 0.1.0 - Starting point.
